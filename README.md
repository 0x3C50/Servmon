# Servmon
A quick and easy solution for managing and installing minecraft servers

## Should I use this?
Depends. Are you focused on managing one server over a long time or focused on setting up and running several servers quickly? If the latter is true, then yes.

## But how do I use this?
1. Install java 17 or later
2. Clone this repo
3. Compile the jarfile using gradle
4. Run it
5. Look at help (java -jar Servmon.jar help), or at an individual command's help (java -jar Servmon.jar [command] --help)

## What does this do exactly?
Let us compare this with another program, https://github.com/alvesvaren/mccli.

For our comparison, lets use the learning process of riding a bike.

Mccli is like a good parent, who teaches its child how to drive safely and securely, and guides it through the process all the way through, but you have to make the bike yourself.

Servmon gets all the parts for the bike, assembles it and tells the child to drive it to get beer from the store.

Servmon works best as the bike builder, while mccli is for teaching the child how to drive.
